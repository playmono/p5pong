# p5pong
A pong game made with [p5js](https://p5js.org/).

I made the game as part of the work for the "Web programming" subject at the [UOC University](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html).

### Play
Download the project and open the `index.html` in a browser or just [play it online](https://playmono.github.io/p5pong/)

### Features
1. **Player size**: as long as this value grows, the player size will become smaller.
2. **Ball speed**: as long as this value grows, the ball will move faster.
3. **Enemy speed**: as long as this value grows, the enemy will have less latency to reach the ball.
